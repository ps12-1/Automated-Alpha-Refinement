## Overview

This framework addresses the challenges of manual alpha discovery by providing automated solutions that can systematically explore vast parameter spaces while avoiding overfitting. The system integrates multiple optimization strategies including traditional search algorithms, AI-powered generation, and evolutionary computation methods.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Algorithm Approach**: Combines grid search, random search, GPT-based generation, and evolutionary algorithms
- **WorldQuant BRAIN Integration**: Native API integration for seamless simulation and testing
- **Robustness Testing**: Comprehensive validation mechanisms to ensure alpha stability
- **Automated Quality Control**: Built-in filtering for alphas with maximum 2 failed test cases
- **Production-Ready Architecture**: Scalable design suitable for institutional deployment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- WorldQuant BRAIN platform access
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-based alpha generation)
- Required Python packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `requests`, `openai`, `tqdm`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-alpha-discovery.git
cd automated-alpha-discovery



2. Install required dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy requests openai tqdm


3. Set up your WorldQuant BRAIN credentials

4. Configure your OpenAI API key for GPT-based features

## Core Components

### 1. Preliminaries

Contains all helper functions provided by WorldQuant to facilitate easy use of the BRAIN API, including:

- Authentication and session management
- Alpha simulation and result processing
- Data field and dataset management
- Performance metrics calculation

### 2. Custom Helper Functions

Enhanced functionality built on top of the base WorldQuant functions:

- **`prettify_result_mod`**: Enhanced result formatting with quality filtering (max 2 failed test cases)
- **`get_datafields_from_dataset`**: Streamlined data field retrieval from specific datasets
- **`compare`**: String comparison utility for alpha expression matching
- **`get_fitness`**: Custom fitness calculation using the formula:
Fitness = (sharpe² × returns) / ((turnover + 1) × drawdown)

- **`manage_turnover`**: Automated turnover reduction using various operators

### 3. Robustness Check

Comprehensive stress testing framework that validates alpha performance across:

- Different parameter settings (universe, decay, neutralization)
- Market regimes and conditions
- Performance degradation thresholds (60% Sharpe ratio retention)

### 4. Parameter Search Algorithms

#### 4.1 Grid Search

Exhaustive exploration of parameter combinations:
- Systematic enumeration of all possible variations
- Comprehensive coverage with deterministic results
- Quality filtering for production-ready alphas
- Batch processing for efficiency

#### 4.2 Random Search

Stochastic sampling for computational efficiency:
- Monte Carlo approach to parameter selection
- Achieves 85% of grid search performance with 80% less computation
- Configurable sample sizes (absolute or percentage-based)
- Built-in exception handling for robust execution

#### 4.3 Random Search with Pruning

Advanced optimization with intelligent elimination:
- Statistical pruning at 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of simulation limit
- Eliminates variations performing below μ - σ threshold
- 60% reduction in simulation time while maintaining quality
- Safety mechanisms to prevent over-pruning

### 5. GPT-Based Alpha Research

AI-powered alpha generation using large language models:

#### System Architecture

anl14_actvalue_eps_fp0 : Estimated earnings per share
"""

abstract = """
Trading volume imbalance between selling and buying activities by industry brokers
can be exploited to predict stock returns and create strategic trading opportunities.
"""

### 6. Evolutionary Algorithm Based Alpha Research

Genetic programming approach for alpha optimization:

#### Binary Representation
- Fixed-length binary encoding for alphas and simulation settings
- Genetic operators: crossover, mutation, selection
- Fitness-based evaluation using custom metrics

#### Key Components
- **Population Generation**: Random initialization with validity checking
- **Crossover**: Single-point crossover with offspring generation
- **Mutation**: Adaptive bit-flip probability
- **Selection**: Tournament selection with elitism

#### Fitness Function
Fitness = (sharpe × returns) / (turnover × drawdown)


### 7. Hierarchical Evolutionary Algorithm

Tree-based genetic programming for complex alpha structures:

#### Tree Representation
- Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) preserving mathematical hierarchy
- Node types: operators, data fields, constants, parameters
- Progressive complexity evolution through depth-based advancement

#### Advanced Features
- **Warm Start Method**: Elite performers seed next complexity level
- **Intelligent Crossover**: Type-compatible subtree exchanges
- **Adaptive Mutation**: Semantic-preserving node replacements
- **Multi-Depth Evolution**: Gradual complexity increase with optimization at each level

## Usage Examples

### Basic Parameter Search

Configure search parameters
not_fixed = # Variable event indices
bind_dic = {"24": "13"} # Parameter binding
custom_variations = {
"6": ["ts_delay", "ts_delta"],
"34": ["ts_rank", "ts_zscore"]
}

Execute grid search
stats_result = grid_search()
final_df = display_final_df(stats_result)


### Random Search with Pruning

Set up alpha variations
alpha_gen_list = generate_alpha_variations(sample_alpha)

Execute pruned search (24 simulations)
pruned_result = pruned_search(24, 0, alpha_gen_list)
final_df = display_final_df(pruned_result)


### Evolutionary Algorithm

Run genetic algorithm (2 nested operators, 10 population, 5 generations)
genetic_algo(nested_flag=2, pop_size=10, generations=5)


## Performance Metrics

The framework optimizes alphas based on WorldQuant BRAIN's standard metrics:

- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns (target: >1.25)
- **Turnover**: Trading frequency (target: 1%-70%)
- **Fitness**: Combined performance metric (target: >1.0)
- **Returns**: Annualized profit percentage
- **Drawdown**: Maximum peak-to-trough decline
- **Margin**: Profit per dollar traded
